This project is written for macOS and is based on Minilibx.

MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa. It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system. For more you can visit:
